// Node built-ins only. Opens no socket. It reads two local things:
//
//   .noru/.cache/iac-queue.json   what this piece already has open in Noru, plus the organization's
//                                 own assets and risks, written by the skill from
//                                 getSecurityFindings + getOrganizationAssets + getOrganizationRisks.
//                                 The open set is the half of the queue a repository cannot know:
//                                 a rule that stopped firing has a finding somewhere that should be
//                                 closed, and only Noru knows it is still open.
//   the repository                Terraform, CloudFormation, Kubernetes and pipeline configuration.
//
// A finding is a POINTER, never a copy. No matched line text is ever written into the derived facts
// or the manifest — one of the bundled rules fires on a line that contains a credential, and a
// scanner that quoted what it found would put that credential into a committed file and then into a
// public pull request. The citation is `file:line`; read the line there.
//
// Identity: a finding is keyed on the check and on the *resource* it fired against, not on the line
// number. Moving a block down a file must not close one finding and open another; changing what the
// block says must.
//
// Usage:
//   node collect.mjs [--repo=<path>] [--check] [--output=json|text] [--quiet]
// Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 queue missing or manifest drifted (--check), 2 usage/IO error.

// `actions/checkout` — tracked files, and nothing else. A developer scans a working tree, which
// holds whatever else they keep in it: scratch checkouts, worktrees, unpacked archives, generated

# queue_snapshot is what YOUR Noru organization already holds: the findings this piece has open, the
# assets a finding could be attached to, and the risks one could be filed against. It is not shipped
# by this plugin — re-run :scan to refresh it.
#
# The collector can say which line matched which rule. It cannot say whether the finding is real in
# your environment, how bad it is here, or who is going to act on it. Every TODO below is yours.
# The validator enforces:
#   * asset_external_id and risk_id may only name things present in queue_snapshot
#   * interpretation.expires_at is mandatory and is measured from observed_on, not from decided_at
#   * accepting a finding or calling it a false positive still expires, and needs a real rationale
#   * needs_review: true blocks the push
#
# No matched line text appears in this file by design: one of the rules fires on a line that holds a
# credential, and a scanner that quoted what it found would commit it. Read the citation instead.
#
# Run:  python3 <plugin>/scripts/validate_manifest.py .noru/iac-scan.yml
