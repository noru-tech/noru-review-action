"""Validate .noru/iac-scan.yml against the BUNDLED vocabulary and rule set.

Self-contained and atomic:
  * Python standard library only. No pip install, no venv, no network.
  * Technologies, severities, statuses, categories, the per-status expiry horizons and the queue
    tool names come from ../references/vocabulary.json; the rules come from ../references/checks.json.
    Neither file contains framework content and neither ever will.
  * Parses YAML with PyYAML if it happens to be importable, otherwise a bundled fallback loader.

What this validator is really for: a scanner produces a list, and a list is not a finding. Somebody
has to say whether each rule that fired means anything in this environment, how bad it is here, and
until when that judgement stands. Those three answers are what this file insists on.

The rules that are specific to this piece:

  * `interpretation.expires_at` is REQUIRED, and is measured from `observed_on` rather than from
    `decided_at`. A finding observed in March and signed in August is a claim about March's
    configuration however recent the signature is, and anchoring on the signature would let a stale
    observation be renewed forever without anybody looking at the configuration again.
  * How far it may stand depends on the status. An `open` finding is a live observation the next
    scan refreshes. `accepted` and `false_positive` are decisions to leave the configuration alone;
    they get a longer horizon and a hard requirement that the reasoning is actually written down,
    because an acceptance nobody revisits is how a known misconfiguration becomes permanent.
  * `decided_at` cannot precede `observed_on`. You cannot judge a configuration before you saw it.
  * `asset_external_id` and `risk_id` may only name things the queue snapshot says the organization
    already has. This piece never creates an asset and never opens a risk.
  * A citation has to point at the file the finding says it is about. The citation is the whole
    evidence: no matched line text is ever recorded, because one of the rules fires on a line that
    holds a credential.

Requirement 9 is enforced the way the other pieces enforce it: nothing may reference something that
is not in the `queue_snapshot` that came from Noru.

`--as-of=YYYY-MM-DD` turns an already-expired judgement into an error. Leave it off and the file is
judged on its own terms, which is what keeps this validator deterministic; pass it in CI and a
decision nobody has revisited fails the build. Nothing here ever reads the clock by itself.

Usage:
    python3 validate_manifest.py <manifest.yml> [--as-of=YYYY-MM-DD] [--output=json] [--quiet]
                                 [--emit-parsed=<path>]
Exit codes: 0 = valid (warnings allowed), 1 = validation errors, 2 = usage / load error.

    timestamp to a datetime.datetime; the fallback loader leaves both as strings. Every date in
    our manifests is an ISO string by contract, so we strip the timestamp resolver rather than
    converting after the fact -- that keeps the author's exact text, which the error messages
    quote back at them.

    Booleans converge the other way round. PyYAML resolves the YAML 1.1 spellings too -- `yes`,
    `no`, `on`, `off` -- and `ci_gated`, `needs_review`, `profiling` and
    `testing_guidance_available` are booleans by contract, not strings, so here it is the fallback
    that learns PyYAML's set (see _TRUE_WORDS). Same rule in both directions: converge on the type
