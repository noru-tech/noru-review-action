"""Validate .noru/review-signoff.yml against the BUNDLED vocabulary.

Self-contained and atomic:
  * Python standard library only. No pip install, no venv, no network.
  * Review kinds, cadences, cadence windows, dispositions and the queue tool names come from
    ../references/vocabulary.json. There is no framework content in it and there never will be.
  * Parses YAML with PyYAML if it happens to be importable, otherwise a bundled fallback loader.

In this piece the `interpretation` block from contract requirement 8 is not metadata about the
claim — it IS the claim. A review sign-off is exactly "a named person looked at this output on this
date and stands behind it until that one", so the block gets treated as the deliverable:

  * `expires_at` is REQUIRED, not a warning. An attestation with no end date is not a periodic
    review; it is a note.
  * `expires_at` must fall inside the window the declared `cadence` implies. A quarterly review that
    claims a two-year sign-off is not a quarterly review, and nothing else in the file will say so.
  * `decided_at` cannot precede `performed_on`. You cannot sign off a review before you did it.
  * `confirmed + exceptions` must reconcile with `records_reviewed`, and every exception needs a
    disposition and a named owner. A sign-off that does not account for what it covered is a
    signature on an unread page.

Requirement 9 is enforced the same way as in the other pieces: every control and evidence-item id
must appear in the `queue_snapshot` that came from Noru.

`--as-of=YYYY-MM-DD` turns an already-expired sign-off into an error. Leave it off and the file is
judged on its own terms, which is what keeps this validator deterministic; pass it in CI (or before
a release) and a stale attestation fails the build. Nothing here ever reads the clock by itself.

Usage:
    python3 validate_manifest.py <manifest.yml> [--as-of=YYYY-MM-DD] [--output=json] [--quiet]
                                 [--emit-parsed=<path>]
Exit codes: 0 = valid (warnings allowed), 1 = validation errors, 2 = usage / load error.

    timestamp to a datetime.datetime; the fallback loader leaves both as strings. Every date in
    our manifests is an ISO string by contract, so we strip the timestamp resolver rather than
    converting after the fact -- that keeps the author's exact text, which the error messages
    quote back at them.

    Booleans converge the other way round. PyYAML resolves the YAML 1.1 spellings too -- `yes`,
    `no`, `on`, `off` -- and `ci_gated`, `needs_review`, `profiling` and
    `testing_guidance_available` are booleans by contract, not strings, so here it is the fallback
