"""Validate .noru/audit-pack.yml against the BUNDLED vocabulary.

Self-contained and atomic:
  * Python standard library only. No pip install, no venv, no network.
  * Conclusions, inspected kinds, sampling methods, dispositions, the minimum-sample bands, the
    per-conclusion assurance horizons and the queue tool names come from
    ../references/vocabulary.json. There is no framework content in it and there never will be —
    the testing procedure in particular stays behind the API, and this manifest records only
    whether one is available.
  * Parses YAML with PyYAML if it happens to be importable, otherwise a bundled fallback loader.

An audit pack is the one artifact in this toolkit that is mostly ASSEMBLED rather than discovered,
so the questions this validator asks are about whether the assembly holds together:

  * **Did the pack test what Noru put in scope?** Every control id and evidence item id has to be in
    the queue snapshot, and one workpaper covers one control. Two accounts of the same control is
    two conclusions somebody has to reconcile.
  * **Was what it says it inspected actually read?** An inspected artifact or manifest has to be one
    the scan digested, at that digest. What an auditor gets handed has to be the bytes that were
    tested, or the digests in the pack prove nothing.
  * **Can the sample be redrawn?** Method, seed and size are all recorded, the drawn list has to
    match the declared size, and the size has to meet the smallest defensible sample for a
    population that big.
  * **Is the conclusion bounded by the period it is about?** `expires_at` is REQUIRED and is
    measured from the END of the audit window rather than from the signature: a workpaper concludes
    about a period, and signing it late does not extend what it covers. A conclusion of `deficient`
    or `not_tested` gets a short horizon — a control you found broken is not something to sign off
    for a year.
  * **Did somebody other than the preparer look?** A pack reviewed by the person who prepared it is
    recorded as reviewed while nobody checked, which is worse than leaving it unreviewed.

`--as-of=YYYY-MM-DD` turns an already-expired conclusion into an error. Leave it off and the file is
judged on its own terms, which is what keeps this validator deterministic; pass it before an audit
and a pack nobody has renewed fails. Nothing here ever reads the clock by itself.

Usage:
    python3 validate_manifest.py <manifest.yml> [--as-of=YYYY-MM-DD] [--output=json] [--quiet]
                                 [--emit-parsed=<path>]
Exit codes: 0 = valid (warnings allowed), 1 = validation errors, 2 = usage / load error.

    timestamp to a datetime.datetime; the fallback loader leaves both as strings. Every date in
    our manifests is an ISO string by contract, so we strip the timestamp resolver rather than
    converting after the fact -- that keeps the author's exact text, which the error messages
    quote back at them.

    Booleans converge the other way round. PyYAML resolves the YAML 1.1 spellings too -- `yes`,
    `no`, `on`, `off` -- and `ci_gated`, `needs_review`, `profiling` and
    `testing_guidance_available` are booleans by contract, not strings, so here it is the fallback
