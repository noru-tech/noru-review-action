// :diff for the audit-pack piece — contract requirement 5.
//
// Reads two local files and writes nothing to Noru:
//   .noru/.cache/audit-pack.parsed.json  the validated manifest (validate_manifest.py)
//   .noru/.cache/noru-state.json         existing evidence and its control links, written by the
//                                        skill from getOrganizationEvidence
//
// What lands, and what deliberately does not. The pack itself — the index, the sampling worksheets,
// the assembled inventory — is a LOCAL deliverable: it is a point-in-time export for handover, and
// pushing it into Noru would be duplicating a register Noru already keeps. What belongs in the
// register is the part a folder cannot hold: **the tested conclusion for each control over this
// window**, and how it was reached. So one workpaper becomes one evidence record, mapped to the one
// control it is about.
//
// One workpaper, one record, one control. A single blob mapped to forty controls is the antipattern
// that makes evidence unreadable, and it is exactly what "assemble a pack" invites.
//
// No idempotency key is documented for evidence, so this piece does not assume one: every record
// lands with a marker in its description built from the pack key, the workpaper key and a digest of
// the rendered workpaper, and the diff looks for that marker in evidence already in the
// organization. Same workpaper, same content -> skip. Changed content -> a new record, because a
// re-tested control is a different account and an auditor should see both.
//
