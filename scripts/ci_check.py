"""Run one piece headless: scan -> validate -> expiry -> policy -> (diff -> publish preparation).

Standard library only, and by default no network and no credential — that is the whole design
constraint. A fork pull request has no secrets, so the checks that matter most on a pull request
have to be computable from the repository alone. Two of them are:

  1. **Manifest drift.** Re-run the collector and compare its derived facts against the digest
     recorded in the committed `.noru/<piece>.yml`. If they differ, someone changed the code without
     updating the record. Pure local computation: the collector opens no socket, and the digest it
     compares against is a field in the committed file.
  2. **Expired interpretation.** A claim whose expiry has passed, or that is outside the review
     cadence declared for this path. Local computation plus a calendar. See scripts/check_expiry.py.
  3. **Personal data nobody agreed to.** A data category, purpose or subject in the manifest that
     the committed privacy baseline does not permit. The baseline is a floor pinned from Noru so
     this stays offline; Noru is the truth. See scripts/check_policy.py.

The `diff` and publication half genuinely needs Noru, so it is opt-in, and when the inputs it needs
are absent it is reported as skipped rather than failed. REST-backed pieces can publish from this
runner. MCP-backed pieces cannot: their push entrypoint emits the reviewed calls, but only an
authenticated MCP host can execute them. A gate that breaks on every fork pull request gets deleted
in a week.

This file is driven entirely by `plugins/<piece>/piece.json` — entrypoints, artifact path, exit
codes. A piece scaffolded tomorrow works here with no change to this file, and there is a test that
says so.

Credentials: NORU_API_KEY is never read, printed or written by this script. Its *presence* decides
whether the push step can run; its value is passed through the process environment to the piece's
own push entrypoint, which reads it at the point of use. Every step that does not need it is run
with it removed from the child environment, and everything captured from a child process is passed
through redact() before it can reach stdout or the report.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/ci_check.py --piece=<name> [--repo=<path>] [--plugins=<dir>]
        [--mode=gate|warn] [--steps=scan,validate,expiry,policy,diff,push|all]

        [--on-missing-prerequisite=skip|fail] [--report=<path.json>]
        [--output=json|text] [--quiet]

Exit codes — see docs/ci-mode.md for the table and the reasoning:
    0  every requested check passed, or --mode=warn
    1  more than one distinct failure condition; read the report
    2  usage error (you called this wrong)
    3  manifest drift
    4  an interpretation has expired or is outside the declared cadence
    5  the manifest failed validation
    6  a check could not run at all (missing runtime, unreadable declaration, child crash, or a
       collector that parsed no schema in a repository that visibly has one)
    7  the manifest processes personal data the privacy baseline does not permit
